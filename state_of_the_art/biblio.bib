This process provides the information to evaluate the quality of a classification model and to choose the most appropriate technique to solve the specific supervised classification problem at hand. This paper aims to review the most important aspects of the evaluation process of supervised classification algorithms. Thus the overall evaluation process is put in perspective to lead the reader to a deep understanding of it. Additionally, different recommendations about their use and limitations as well as a critical view of the reviewed methods are presented according to the specific characteristics of the supervised classification problem scenario.},

  abstract = {Social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter attract millions of users, who everyday post an enormous amount of content in the form of tweets, comments and posts. Since social network texts are usually short, learning tasks have to deal with a very high dimensional and sparse feature space, in which most features have low frequencies. As a result, extracting useful knowledge from such noisy data is a challenging task, that converts large-scale short-text learning tasks in social environments into one of the most relevant problems in machine learning and data mining. Feature selection is one of the most known and commonly used techniques for reducing the impact of the high dimensional feature space in text learning. A wide variety of feature selection techniques can be found in the literature applied to traditional, long-texts and document collections. However, short-texts coming from the social Web pose new challenges to this well-studied problem as texts' shortness offers a limited context to extract enough statistical evidence about words relations (e.g. correlation), and instances usually arrive in continuous streams (e.g. Twitter timeline), so that the number of features and instances is unknown, among other problems. This paper surveys feature selection techniques for dealing with short texts in both offline and online settings. Then, open issues and research opportunities for performing online feature selection over social media data are discussed.},

  abstract = {In many important application domains such as text categorization, biomolecular analysis, scene classification and medical diagnosis, examples are naturally associated with more than one class label, giving rise to multi-label classification problems. This fact has led, in recent years, to a substantial amount of research on feature selection methods that allow the identification of relevant and informative features for multi-label classification. However, the methods proposed for this task are scattered in the literature, with no common framework to describe them and to allow an objective comparison. Here, we revisit a categorization of existing multi-label classification methods and, as our main contribution, we provide a comprehensive survey and novel categorization of the feature selection techniques that have been created for the multi-label classification setting. We conclude this work with concrete suggestions for future research in multi-label feature selection which have been derived from our categorization and analysis.},
